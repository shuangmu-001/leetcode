     * Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer
     * is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist.
     * Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.
     *
     * Example 1:
     * Input: [1,3,4,2,2]
     * Output: 2
     *
     * Example 2:
     * Input: [3,1,3,4,2]
     * Output: 3
     *
     * Note:
     * You must not modify the array (assume the array is read only).
     * You must use only constant, O(1) extra space.
     * Your runtime complexity should be less than O(n2).
     * There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.
