     * You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.
     * The most significant digit comes first and each of their nodes contain a single digit.
     * Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.
     *
     * You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
     *
     * Follow up:
     * What if you cannot modify the input lists? In other words, reversing the lists is not allowed.
     *
     * Example:
     *
     * Input: (7 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
     * Output: 7 -> 8 -> 0 -> 7
